# Splunk SIEM Lab – SSH Brute Force Detection

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a hands-on Splunk SIEM deployment on Linux, focusing on authentication log ingestion, failed SSH login detection, and alerting for potential brute-force attacks.

The lab simulates a SOC-style workflow including log onboarding, field extraction, detection engineering, and alert configuration.

## 🧱 Lab Environment
- **Platform:** Oracle VirtualBox
- **OS:** REMnux (Linux)
- **SIEM:** Splunk Enterprise 10.x
- **Log Source:** `/var/log/auth.log`
- **Access Method:** SSH (local simulation)

## ⚙️ Splunk Setup

### Splunk Web Interface
Splunk Enterprise was installed and accessed via the web interface.

## 📥 Log Ingestion

The Linux authentication log was monitored and ingested into Splunk to capture login activity, including successful and failed SSH attempts.

**Monitored log file:**


Events were indexed into the default `main` index and validated through Splunk Search.

## 🔍 Failed SSH Login Detection

Failed SSH authentication attempts were identified by searching for standard failure messages generated by `sshd`.

```spl
index=main "Failed password"

## 🚨 Brute Force Detection

To identify potential SSH brute-force activity, source IP addresses were extracted from raw authentication logs and aggregated to detect repeated failures from the same origin.

```spl
index=main "Failed password"
| rex "from (?<src_ip>[0-9a-fA-F:.]+)"
| stats count by src_ip
| where count >= 1
| sort - count

index=main "Failed password"
| timechart count
